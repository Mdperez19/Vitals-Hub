# VitalsHub - Auxiliary System for Patient Monitoring in Hospitals

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Introduction

VitalsHub is a project developed for the Software Engineering subject. It aims to provide assistance in monitoring the vital signs of patients in hospitals. With the increasing number of patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals often face challenges in promptly addressing patient needs.

The objective of VitalsHub is to develop a tool that can help healthcare providers track vital signs efficiently, reducing response time in critical situations. By utilizing sensors for measuring oxygen levels, temperature, and heart rate, VitalsHub captures and processes vital sign data using a microcontroller. This data is then transmitted to software for analysis and storage in a secure database.

## General Objective

The main goal of the VitalsHub project is to develop a tool that aids in the monitoring of a patient's vital signs.

## Specific Objectives

The specific objectives of the project are as follows:

- Acquire vital signs using sensors for measuring oxygen levels, temperature, and heart rate.
- Process the acquired vital signs using a microcontroller.
- Transmit the values of the vital signs from a patient to software for further analysis.
- Store personal and clinical data of a patient in a database.

## Frontend Details

The frontend of the VitalsHub project has been implemented using Angular version 12.1.1. **This README focuses solely on the frontend and does not include details about the backend**.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the frontend of the VitalsHub project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/Mdperez19/Vitals-Hub.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd VitalsHub
3. Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
4. Start the Angular development server: ng serve
5. Access the application in your browser at: http://localhost:4200

## Usage

Once the VitalsHub frontend is running, you can use the application to perform the following tasks:

- View and monitor the vital signs of patients.
- Search and retrieve stored patient data from the database.
- Display real-time updates of vital sign measurements.
- Analyze trends and generate reports based on the collected data.

Please note that the functionality mentioned above is specific to the frontend of the VitalsHub project and requires integration with the backend to work seamlessly.
